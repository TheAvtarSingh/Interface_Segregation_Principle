### In the SOLID principles of object-oriented design,

#### "I" - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

_This principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use_.

##### In other words,

_it's better to have smaller, more specific interfaces that are tailored to the needs of the classes that implement them, rather than having large, general interfaces that force classes to implement methods they don't need._

` Use only needed interfaces`
